Wales has three National Parks: Snowdonia National Park, Brecon Beacons National Park and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. National Parks, amongst other things, exist to conserve and enhance the natural beauty wildlife and cultural heritage of the park and promote enjoyment for the public. Importantly National Park Authorities also have control over planning in each of their respective areas. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), on the other hand, although being protected to some degree from development, do not have their own planning powers, mainly due to their lack of size and lack of wilderness. Wales has 5 AONBs accompanying it's 3 National Parks and blog entry discusses the Clwydian Range AONB.", "The Clwydian Range AONB, running from Llandegla in the south to Prestatyn in the north, was established in 1985, the last of the 5 AONBs to be established in Wales. The others being: Gower (1956), Llyn Peninsula (1956), Anglesey (1967) and the Wye Valley (1971). Known in Welsh as Brynian Clwyd, the AONB covers the Clwyds, a series of hills that form a natural barrier between England and Wales (although the actual border is found further east). Vistors to Wales will likely see the AONB as they travel down the A55, although it's likely they are headed for Snowdonia or Anglesey, rather than the AONB itself. So what does it have to offer a visitor?", "By far and away the most popular destination in the AONB is Moel Famau, the highest point at 555m. Moel Famau is not the highest point in north east wales, which is instead taken by the substantially higher and more remote Cadair Berwyn at 832m. If you want to enjoy gorgeous far-reaching views across England and Wales then ply the roughly 2km from the southern car park at Bwlch Penbarras. On a summer's day the walk to the summit and the accompanying car parks can be busy, although not overcrowded like other peaks in Snowdonia. However, head to any of the other of the hills in the Clwydian Range and you re very likely to find yourself alone, perhaps the best way to enjoy the AONBs beauty. If you have already done Moel Famau, or fancy something slightly different then it's well worth visiting Moel Arthur, a 455m peak with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort. You are unlikely to encounter anyone else on Moel Famau, except for the odd local avoiding the crowds on Moel Famau. It's a short walk from a good car park, less than a mile or so, with the only difficulty likely to be the steepness of the terrain. The walk can also be easily extended, by adding a loop to Pen Y Cloddiau and walking along some of Offas Dyke, the earthwork that follows the border between much of England and Wales", "The Clwyds", "Moel Famau", "Moel Arthur", "https://live.staticflickr.com/5329/7197929950_61dd5b7f0b_b.jpg", "https://live.staticflickr.com/4488/23574767388_d94422d4fb_b.jpg", "https://live.staticflickr.com/1874/44694401182_c9ba59141a_b.jpg", "The Clwyds: paul_p! license CC BY 2", "Moel Famau: JPSimages license CC BY-ND 2", "Moel Arthur: clairemcox license CC BY-ND 2", "1: Clwydian Range AONB")
