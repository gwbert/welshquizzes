bestCastle = shortblog("Wales' finest castle is without doubt Conwy Castle. Boasting UNESCO World Heritage Status, mesmerizing town walls and a gorgeous view towards the Great Orme, it ticks every box. Built by Edward I between 1283 and 1289 as part of his North Wales Ring of Iron, Conwy Castle dominates the local landscape, with its eight towers and outstanding town walls a monument to its historical importance. The best way to take in its historical grandeur is to approach it via the Conwy Suspension Bridge, a Thomas Teford designed bridge, originally opened in 1826 as a road bridge carrying the A55 and now only passable by foot. With the marina on your right, the faux-medieval railway bridge on your left and the castle and town right in front, there is no finer historical sight in Wales.", "Conwy Castle", "https://live.staticflickr.com/7392/10281372026_cfc9840de5_b.jpg", "hAl1927 license CC BY 2", "Conwy: Wales' Finest Castle")

clwydsBlog = blog("There's a clear hierarchy of Protected National Spaces with National Parks sitting squarely at the top. Wales has three National Parks: Snowdonia National Park, Brecon Beacons National Park and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. National Parks, amongst other things, exist to conserve and enhance the natural beauty wildlife and cultural heritage of the park and promote enjoyment for the public. Importantly National Park Authorities also have control over planning in each of their respective areas. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), on the other hand, although being protected to some degree from development, do not have their own planning powers, mainly due to their lack of size and lack of wilderness. Wales has 5 AONBs accompanying it's 3 National Parks and blog entry discusses the Clwydian Range AONB.", "The Clwydian Range AONB, running from Llandegla in the south to Prestatyn in the north, was established in 1985, the last of the 5 AONBs to be established in Wales. The others being: Gower (1956), Llyn Peninsula (1956), Anglesey (1967) and the Wye Valley (1971). Known in Welsh as Brynian Clwyd, the AONB covers the Clwyds, a series of hills that form a natural barrier between England and Wales (although the actual border is found further east). Vistors to Wales will likely see the AONB as they travel down the A55, although it's likely they are headed for Snowdonia or Anglesey, rather than the AONB itself. So what does it have to offer a visitor?", "By far and away the most popular destination in the AONB is Moel Famau, the highest point at 555m. Moel Famau is not the highest point in north east wales, which is instead taken by the substantially higher and more remote Cadair Berwyn at 832m. If you want to enjoy gorgeous far-reaching views across England and Wales then ply the roughly 2km from the southern car park at Bwlch Penbarras. On a summer's day the walk to the summit and the accompanying car parks can be busy, although not overcrowded like other peaks in Snowdonia. However, head to any of the other of the hills in the Clwydian Range and you re very likely to find yourself alone, perhaps the best way to enjoy the AONBs beauty. If you have already done Moel Famau, or fancy something slightly different then it's well worth visiting Moel Arthur, a 455m peak with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort. You are unlikely to encounter anyone else on Moel Famau, except for the odd local avoiding the crowds on Moel Famau. It's a short walk from a good car park, less than a mile or so, with the only difficulty likely to be the steepness of the terrain. The walk can also be easily extended, by adding a loop to Pen Y Cloddiau and walking along some of Offas Dyke, the earthwork that follows the border between much of England and Wales", "The Clwyds", "Moel Famau", "Moel Arthur", "https://live.staticflickr.com/5329/7197929950_61dd5b7f0b_b.jpg", "https://live.staticflickr.com/4488/23574767388_d94422d4fb_b.jpg", "https://live.staticflickr.com/1874/44694401182_c9ba59141a_b.jpg", "The Clwyds: paul_p! license CC BY 2", "Moel Famau: JPSimages license CC BY-ND 2", "Moel Arthur: clairemcox license CC BY-ND 2", "1: Clwydian Range AONB")
landOfTheCastle = blog("Wales is said to have more castles per square metre than any other country on earth. An astonishing statistic that leaves stunning historical architecture in every corner of Wales. There are many types of castle in Wales, with the main being Edward's Ring of Iron (North Wales), the Norman Castles (South Wales) and those built by the Welsh. Taking Edward's Ring of Iron whilst it's easy to be blown away by the beauty and dominance of Conwy, Caernarfon and Harlech, it's Beaumaris Castle that steals the show for me. Famously unfinished, as Edward I turned his attention to Scotland, it is said to be one of the best examples of concentric castle design and as you walk around and inside it you soon see how true this is. For me it feels like Edward I had perfected Castle building with each piece of his Ring of Iron and when he reached Beaumaris he knew exactly what he wanted, even if it ultimately remained unfinished as it wasn't needed anymore. Another beautiful aspect of the castle is the view towards Snowdonia, perhaps one of the finest views in Britain when Snowdonia has received a light sprinkling of snow as you look out over the Menai Strait.", "Turning south we find the Norman castles, built as the Normans came into Wales from the Marches from 1066. One of the earliest examples can be found in Chepstow, started in 1067 by Earl William fitz Osbern. Perched on cliffs above the lower reaches of the River Wye, Chepstow is a majestic castle in a charming town, well worth a visit. It is said to have the oldest castle doors in Europe, although they are now displayed within the castle rather than hanging in their original place. The doors, originally believed to be from the 13th century have now been dated to no later than the 1190s. The main Norman castles built around this time were: Pembroke, Chepstow, Caerphilly, Kidwelly and Cardiff. It wasn't until 200 years later that Edward I would do the same in North Wales.", "So far we've looked at the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is Edward I's Ring of Iron in North Wales and we've also looked at the grand Norman castles that the Marches Lords constructed in South Wales as they pushed in from the English border. But perhaps my favourite of all types of castles in Wales are the Welsh castles. Domestic castles built by Welsh Princes to keep out the English. They are usually found deep within the boundaries of Wales and are of a more simple construction, making use more of geographic features to aid their defensive qualities than than the monied grandeur of a Conwy or a Caperhilly. Great examples are Dolbadarn, which dominates the Llanberis Pass and Dolwyddelan, likely the birthplae of Llywelyn the Great, but my personal favourite is the now-ruined Castell-y-bere, well worth a visit if you find yourself at the southern tip of Snowdonia National Park.", "Beaumaris Castle", "Chepstow Castle", "Castell y bere", "https://live.staticflickr.com/8599/15966969495_ea3de02643_b.jpg", "https://live.staticflickr.com/5103/5635180932_d5a49123a2_b.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Castell_y_Bere_and_Bird%27s_Rock.jpg", "Beaumaris Castle: Bo&Ko license CC BY-SA 2", "Chepstow Castle: Gordon M Robertson license CC BY 2", "Castell y bere: Gareth James license CC BY-SA 2", "Wales: land of the castle")
m4 = blog("The tunnels, the average speed cameras, the old bridge, the new bridge, the tolls, the removal of tolls, the missing junction, closing Port Talbot off, not closing it off, the relief road that won't be built, or will it? The M4 is never far from people's lips in south Wales. In the north on the other hand it's never on anyone's lips, mainly because Wales is such a badly-joined up country. Just don't get them started on the A55. The M4, fully opened to Pont Abraham Services in 1993, is vital to the south Wales economy, connecting it more or less seemlessly, at least now the tolls have been removed, into south west England and London. You are unlikely to forget the first view you get of the Welsh side of the M4 as you come down the brow of a hill north of Bristol to see both bridges (on a good day) stretching across the Severn estuary below you. It's a beautiful sight and a great way to start your journey into Wales.", "Unless you live in Chepstow or are visiting the Forest of Dean or the Wye Valley, you are unlikely to go over the old Severn bridge. Opened by the Queen in 1966, the old bridge is 0.99 miles long (as opposed to a little over 3 miles for the Second Severn Crossing), and can be split into the Severn Bridge itself (crossing the river Severn from Aust to Beachley), the Beachley viaduct (crossing Beachley Barracks) and the Wye Bridge, where you finally enter Wales. On reaching Wales you then reach the M48, the old M4, a 12 mile stretch of road with hardly any traffic that connects the Old Severn Bridge to Magor Services. The original Severn Bridge is a wonderful sight at any time of year, especially at night when lit up by lights on the suspension cables. The best way to experience the bridge is to walk or cycle over it, something that cannot be done on the Second Severn Crossing. The bridge has been strengthened various times over the years as traffic has grown in quantity and having received its Grade I status in 1998 is likely to be with us for years to come.", "The Second Severn Crossing, officially renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge, was commissioned in the 1980s as traffic on the old Severn Bridge was expected to hit capacity. Built south of the old Severn Bridge, the Second Severn Crossing is far more modern bridge, using advanced aerodynamic techniques to ensure it is closed far less often than its northern neighbour. Taken together the bridges are an iconic part of the M4 and M48, a visible demonstration that you are passing from one country to another and yet these countries are connected closely together. Unlike the old Severn Bridge there is no provision for crossing the Second Severn Crossing by foot or by bicycle and the best way to view the bridge is from Severn Beach on the English side of the river. Here you can get an amazing view of the bridge was well as walk or cycle underneath a part of it. A similar view can be had from had from the Welsh side at Black Rock picnic site, reachable from Portskewett.", "Severn Bridges", "Old Severn Bridge", "Second Severn Crossing", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Severn_Bridge_%2816563933745%29.jpg", "https://live.staticflickr.com/7350/13868528983_7d59908a93_b.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/New_Severn_Bridge_-_panoramio.jpg", "Severn Bridge Tower: Sam Saunders license CC BY-SA 2", "Severn Bridge: Steve Slater (used to be Wildlife Encounters) licensed CC BY 2", "Second Severn Crossing: Matt Prosser license CC BY-SA 3", "Severn Bridges")
